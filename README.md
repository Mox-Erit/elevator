# Elevator Project

## Installing the project

```bash
# git clone REPO
git clone REPO
npm create svelte@latest

# change into repo directory
cd repo

```

## Developing

Once you've copied the project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install` (or `npm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
pnpm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:
